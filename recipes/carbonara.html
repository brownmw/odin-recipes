        <p class="desc">Carbonara is an Italian pasta dish from Rome made with eggs, hard cheese, 
            cured pork, and black pepper. The dish arrived at its modern form, with 
            its current name, in the middle of the 20th century. A decadent meal
            that will prove a crowdpleaser. Serves 2.</p>

            <li>180g spaghetti (or linguine)</li>

        <h3 class="inst">Instructions</h3>
        <ol class="inst">
            <li>Add a small amount of salt to a saucepan (just large enough for the 
                spaghetti) of boiling water, then add the spaghetti and cook until al
                dente.
            </li>
            <li>Put a frying pan over a moderate to high heat then add the pancetta,
                cook until crispy.
            </li>
            <li>Crack 2 whole eggs and 1 egg yolk in to a bowl and briefly mix.</li>
            <li>Grate the pecorino and mix in with the eggs then season the mixture 
                with a generous amount of black pepper.
            </li>
            <li>Once the pancetta and spaghetti are cooked, using tongs add the spaghetti
                to the frying pan; don't worry about draining water from the spaghetti.
            </li>
            <li>After spaghetti has been added, also add a ladel or two of the water the 
                pasta cooked in and frying until the water is mostly evaporated.
            </li>
            <li>Take the pan off the heat and allow to cool slightly before pouring in the
                egg and cheese mix. Keep the pasta and sauce moving continuously to avoid
                scrambling the eggs, while the cheese melts.
            </li>
            <li>The pasta is now ready to serve, however, you could also move the pan breifly
                back on to the heat (keeping the pasta moving) in order to thicken the sauce
                to your preference.
            </li>
        </ol>
