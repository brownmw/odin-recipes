    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Enjera is a sour fermented flatbread with slightly spongy texture, traditionally
            made from teff flour. It is a staple food across Eritrea and Ethiopia and even serves
            as the plate and eating utensil for a variety of stews. Makes 4 small enjera.
        </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>20g sourdough starter (optional)</li>
            <li>240mL water</li>
            <li>230g teff flour</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Mix together the water and teff flour, along with the sourdough 
                starter if you wish to use that. The mixture should like clay.
            </li>
            <li>Cover with plastic wrap and leave in a warm place to ferment for
                2 days.
            </li>
            <li>Add more water until the mix has the consistency of a pancake/crepe
                batter. Re-cover and leave for a futher 1-3 days (depending on how sour 
                you would like the enjera to be).
            </li>
            <li>The teff will likely have sedimented out of the mixture. If there
                is any black growth on the surface of the water, pour out until fully 
                removed and then add more water to return the consistency to that of 
                pancake/crepe batter.
            </li>
            <li>Ideally inn a crepe pan (but a normal frying pan will also do), pour the 
                batter in a spiral starting at the outer edge and moving inwards until the 
                cooking surface is fully covered. Cover the pan with a lid and allow to cook 
                for a couple of minutes.
            </li>
            <li>Once cooked, carefully remove and stack the cook enjera on top of each other 
                before serving.
            </li>
        </ol>
