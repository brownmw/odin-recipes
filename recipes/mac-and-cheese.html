            <li>3 Tbsp butter</li>
            <li>3 Tbsp flour</li>
            <li>1 Tbsp english mustard</li>
            <li>710mL milk</li>
            <li>1 finely diced medium onion</li>
            <li>1 bay leaf</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp paprika</li>
            <li>1 large egg</li>
            <li>255g grated mature cheddar</li>
            <li>salt</li>
            <li>pepper</li>
        </ul>
        <h5>Breadcrumb Topping</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>3 Tbsp butter</li>
            <li>85g panko breadcrumbs</li>
            <li>85g grated mature cheddar</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 170Â°</li>
            <li>Add salt to a large pan along with boiling water and place on 
                high heat. When at a rolling boil add the pasta and cook until al
                dente (around 8 minutes). Drain when cooked.
            </li>
            <li>While the pasta is boiling, melt the butter in a medium sized pan
                over a medium heat then add the flour. Mix to combine and cook for 
                5 minutes (keep it moving throughout).
            </li>
            <li>Stir in the milk, onion, bay leaf, mustard and paprika. Simmer for
                10 minutes as the sauce thickens then remove the bay leaf.
            </li>
            <li>Temper the egg by placing a small glass bowl on a tea towel so it 
                doesn't easily move. Whisk the egg until homogenous then with the whisk
                in your dominant hand and the ladel in the other, slowly pour a steady stream
                of the sauce whilst continuously whisking. You want to warm the egg without 
                scrambling it. Once a few ladels of sauce have been incorporated and the egg 
                and sauce mix are around the same temperature as the rest of the sauce. Pour 
                the egg mixture in to the main sauce.
            </li>
            <li>Stir the cheese and mix until melted, then season with salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>Fold the cooked macaroni in to the sauce then pour in a suitably sized
                casserole/glass dish.
            </li>
            <li>Add the remaining cheese over the top of the pasta.</li>
            <li>Melt the butter in a saute or frying pan and add the breadcrumbs. Mix until
                evenly coated.
            </li>
            <li>Top the macaroni with the breadcrumbs.</li>
            <li>Bake for 30 minutes and rest for 5 minutes before serving.</li>
